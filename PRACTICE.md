## Needed Review

Collections with no bounded generic type and their behavior

Review how to get items out of queue

flatmap practice

Look at generics and when to include the parameters declaring them as generics

Look at a shallow copy of directories when using copy

reassignment of Exception e within a catch block. Can you do it? How about multi-catch block?

Supressed exceptions - throw exception in try, and when trying to close the auto-closing resources
Java will save info from both exceptions. how are they accessed?

NavigableMap extends SortedMap extends Map
TreeMap is a class that implements these interfaces 

findAny non-determinism
rangeClosed
even if you are passed the arguments in order, findAny was deliberately designed to be non-deterministic

max(Comparator c) works apparently and then returns an Optional

Interface that can be implemented by a class so that it can execute in a separate thread without using any other framework classes

new Thread(Runnable r); ??? 
How is Callable different?

Callable is not instanceof Runnable
Pass runnable to a thread constructor to run in a new thread
